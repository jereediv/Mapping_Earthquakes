# Mapping_Earthquakes

## Overview:
The goal here is to create a map using GeoJSON data that has multiple base layers as well as multipler overlays.

## Summing it up:
With the use of Leaflet and MapBox APIs, we created the base of our map. Then we added data from our JSON source file using d3.json functions. Base layers include street, satellite, and dark with overlay options including fault lines, all earthquakes, and major earthquakes for the last 7 days. Since, we used an API along with data from the USGS we created a real-time style map to view recent earthquake activity accross the world. I would be interested in using these types of mapping to look at weather data like current radar, cloud cover and future forecasts.
